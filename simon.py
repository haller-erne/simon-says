# The original Simon game has three game modes:
#
# Single Player – The game generates a sequence of lights and sounds which the player must follow, 
#   the sequence grows by one colour every turn and ends when the player makes a mistake or repeats 
#   the maximum number of colours in a sequence (which is dependent on the skill level setting)
# Multi Player (game 2) – The game begins with Simon displaying a colour, the first player must 
#   repeat the colour and then select another colour, subsequent players must enter the current 
#   sequence and then add one more, the next player then selects the sequence of colours entered so 
#   far and then one more and so on until a player makes a mistake (or a sequence of 31 colours is achieved).
# Multi Player (game 3) – This game is identical to game one, however each player owns one or more 
#   colours and is responsible for pressing it during the sequence. If a colour is incorrectly selected 
#   that colour is removed from the game and the game continues (with a new colour sequence) until only 
#   one colour is left (the winner)
#
# The game also features 4 skill levels:
#   1 - Repeat a sequence of 8 colours
#   2 - Repeat a sequence of 14 colours
#   3 - Repeat a sequence of 20 colours
#   4 - Repeat a sequence of 31 colours
# To play games 2 and 3 the skill level selector must be in position 4 or the game will end prematurely 
# (this is due to the ‘skill level’ performing the same function in all game modes; in the multi‐player 
# games the maximum sequence number Simon can handle gives the longest game play).
#
# The game hardware consists of 4 coloured lens which, when pressed, operate switches on the circuit board. 
# The colours from top‐left going clockwise are red, blue, yellow and green on the Pocket Simon and green, 
# red, blue and yellow on the full‐size version.
# 
# There are 3 push buttons on the game:
# - Last: Replays the sequence from the last game (only operates when the game is not in progress)
# - Start: Starts a new game (can be pressed at any time)
# - Longest: Replays the longest sequence successfully completed since the game was turned on (only 
#   operates when the game is not in progress)
#
# There are 2 sliding switches on the game (on the full‐sized game there is an additional on‐off switch 
# which in the pocket version is replaced by a two‐pole game switch):
# - Game: Off, 1, 2 and 3
# - Skill: 1, 2, 3 and 4
